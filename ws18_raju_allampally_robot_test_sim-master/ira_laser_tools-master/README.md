**To launch the package (Merges Front Laser and Rear Laser Scan into Single)**:

`roslaunch ira_laser_tools laserscan_multi_merger.launch`

This library includes some tools for laser handling in ROS. At the moment two nodes are available:

 - laserscan_multi_merger
 - laserscan_virtualizer

The Package was used to combine the Front Laser Scan and the Rear Bottom Laser Scan into the Single Laser topic.
Which can be used effectivley in Navigation and Mapping.

We would like to thank Iralab Lab,(Informatics and Robotics for Automation), Milan for pubslishing the following packages.
